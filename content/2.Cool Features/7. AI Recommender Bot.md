## Can you show me the cover art for Clannad and information about that anime?

"**Clannad**" is a beloved anime that blends elements of comedy, drama, romance, and the supernatural within a slice-of-life setting. The story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a disillusioned high school student whose life takes a significant turn upon meeting a peculiar girl named Nagisa Furukawa. As they grow closer, Tomoya becomes increasingly involved with various other girls at school, each with her own unique story, leading to profound personal growth and emotional connections.

The anime is well-regarded for its exploration of themes such as family, friendship, the challenges of adulthood, and the impact of past traumas. It stands out for its deeply emotional storytelling, memorable characters, and its ability to blend light-hearted moments with tear-jerking drama.

The first season aired in the fall of 2007 and comprises 23 episodes. It's followed by "Clannad: After Story," which delves deeper into the characters' lives post-high school, further expanding on the themes of life's hardships and the strength found in love and family. "After Story" is particularly praised for its emotional depth and storytelling.
