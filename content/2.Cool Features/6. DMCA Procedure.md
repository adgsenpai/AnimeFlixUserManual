# DMCA Procedure

## What is DMCA?
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a United States copyright law designed to protect the rights of copyright owners while facilitating a legal environment where digital content can be shared responsibly.

## How can DMCA affect us?
Compliance with the DMCA is essential for our platform, as it shields us from potential legal liabilities arising from copyright infringement claims. Non-compliance can lead to lawsuits, financial penalties, and a loss of trust from our user community.

## DMCA Non-Compliance Lawsuit
Ignoring DMCA regulations can result in non-compliance lawsuits, leading to significant legal consequences, including statutory damages, legal costs, and potential operational restrictions on our platform.

## Our Compliance to DMCA
We adhere to the DMCA by:
- Establishing a clear process for handling DMCA takedown notices.
- Removing content that is identified as infringing upon receiving a valid notice.
- Taking steps to prevent repeat infringements by users.

## Reporting a DMCA Notice via GitHub
To report a DMCA violation on our platform, follow these steps on GitHub:
1. **Fork the Repository**: Navigate to our [DMCA-ADGSTUDIOS-LIST repository](https://github.com/adgsenpai/DMCA-ADGSTUDIOS-LIST) on GitHub and fork it to your account.
2. **Modify the List**: Add the infringing content's URL to the `list.txt` file, which can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adgsenpai/DMCA-ADGSTUDIOS-LIST/main/static/db/list.txt).
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Create a pull request with your modifications for review.
4. **Include Evidence**: Within your pull request, clearly document evidence of the infringement to support your claim.

## How to Remove Content from Our Website via GitHub
Once a DMCA notice is validated, the content will be removed as follows:
1. The infringing content will be immediately taken down from our platform.
2. We will update the `list.txt` file in our [DMCA-ADGSTUDIOS-LIST repository](https://github.com/adgsenpai/DMCA-ADGSTUDIOS-LIST) to reflect the removal.
3. The user who posted the infringing content will be notified and given information about the takedown.

By incorporating GitHub into our DMCA compliance process, we ensure transparency, efficiency, and community involvement in maintaining a legally compliant and respectful platform.
